Hi,

I think this problem has been resolved, but here is some feedback in case anyone is following this thread:

The pipeline below is generally OK, but is much more complicated than it needs to be.  Instead we recommend the following:

 1 - Run bet on your fieldmap magnitude image, and possibly erode the result to make sure that it is "tight" and there are definitely no voxels left outside of the brain (as these normally correspond to noisy voxels in the fieldmap phase, and extrapolating out from within the brain is fine for the fieldmap, so missing parts of the brain are to be preferred over leaving non-brain tissue behind in this specific case).

 2 - Run fsl_prepare_fieldmap (GUI or command-line) to create a fieldmap in units of rad/s 

 3 - Run epi_reg using your structural, a brain-extracted version of your structural (but this time do not erode as above, and a bit of non-brain tissue left is much better than excluding brain tissue in this case), plus the fieldmap images from above.

Or, you can do step 3 via pre-stats in the FEAT GUI.

All the best,
	Mark
