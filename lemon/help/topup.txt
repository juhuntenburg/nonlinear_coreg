# estimate the field: topup
--imain= all the images used for estimation in a 4d file (for us: pos and neg blips before and after rest run)
###fslroi, fslmerge
--datain= textfile describing the 4d file, 3 rows phase encoding, 4th row total readout time (defined as the time from the centre of the first echo to the centre of the last) in seconds (87*0.00067? -> EPI Faktor 88, Dwell Time 0.67 ms, see FAQ)
--config= ascii-file with one row for each parameter to specify for topup, and where comments (ignored by topup) are preceeded by a #, starting point: b02b0.cnf (check subsampling)
--out
--fout= output field (spline coefficients convoled with spline kernel)
--iout= unwarped and movement corrected images (only the input ones), uses traditional interpolation and Jacobian modulation
movpar.txt -> describes movement relative to first volume (translation, rotation)
fieldcoeff.nii -> spline coefficients encoding the field, smaller and continuous

#warpres:  specify a knot-spacing smaller than two voxels in the direction with the smallest voxel size
#scale: the input images should have similar intensities

# Note that b02b0.cnf uses sub-sampling to speed up the estimation and that topup requires that the image-size is a multiple of the sub-sampling level. So, for example if you want to use sub-sampling by a factor of 2 the image-size should be a multiple of 2 in all directions (e.g. 96x96x48))

# unwarping: applytopup


correcting for distortions and movement between the b0
