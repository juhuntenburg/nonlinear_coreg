*** version_1 ***
master, original, github


*** version_2 ***
changing to bspline
parameters as described in original paper

transforms = ['BSplineSyN']
transform_parameters = [(0.1,26,0,3)]
number_of_iterations = [[100,70,50,20]]
shrink_factors = [[6,4,2,1]]
smoothing_sigmas = [[3,2,1,0]]


*** version_3 ***
fmap mask
no masking of epi nor anat before ants
register fmap mask to both images and use within ants

comment out all masking
reset inputs from masked epi to tmean out and mask anat to mriconvert out 
(anat_min_max, epi_min_max, mulinv, antsreg fixed)

additional inputs to inputnode
'norm_lin', 'norm_warp', 'fmap_mask'

additional nodes for warping the fieldmap mask into anat and epi space
(makelist/transformlist, warpmask_anat, addlist/transformlist2, warpmask_epi)

additional inputs to antsreg
(warpmask_anat, 'output_image', antsreg, 'moving_image_mask')
(warpmask_epi, 'output_image', antsreg, 'fixed_image_mask')


*** version_4 ***
dilate fmap mask by 2 before transforming (change input to warpmask_anat/_epi)
apply fmap mask warped into respective space (anat, epi) BEFORE inverting
(change input to anat/epi_min_max, mulinv, antsreg)
remove mask inputs to antsreg


*** version_5 ***
starting from version 1 (actually started form 2 but then changed back to syn)
mask with aparc+aseg instead of ribbon 
- dilate 10 erode 7

back to syn:
transforms = ['SyN'],
transform_parameters = [(0.10,3,0)],
number_of_iterations = [[10,5]],
shrink_factors = [[2,1]],
smoothing_sigmas = [[1,0.5]],


*** version_6 ***
starting from version 4 (fmap masking, improved fmap mask) 
but back to syn (like in 5)

*** version_7 ***
fmap mask syn more iterations
number_of_iterations = [[100,70,50]],
shrink_factors = [[4,2,1]],
smoothing_sigmas = [[3,2,1]],


*** version_8 *** 
starting from version 5 
increasing iterations to:
number_of_iterations = [[100,70,50,20]]
shrink_factors = [[6,4,2,1]]
smoothing_sigmas = [[3,2,1,0]]


*** version_9 ***
starting from version 5
restricting completely to PE

*** version_10 ***
like 9, strict PE but for many iterations (starting from version 8)

*** version_11 ***
starting from v5 (syn wholebrain few moderate)
switching to bspline, but with few iterations

transforms = ['BSplineSyN']
transform_parameters = [(0.1,26,0,3)]


*** version_12 ***
like 11 but with many iterations (similar to 2 but here with whole brain mask)
number_of_iterations = [[100,70,50,20]]
shrink_factors = [[6,4,2,1]]
smoothing_sigmas = [[3,2,1,0]]


*** version_13 ***
like 6 but strict

*** version_14 ***
like 7 but strict

*** version_15 ***
like 4 (fmap bspline moderate) but few iterations

*** version_16 ***
like 11 (whole bspline few) but strict

*** version 17 ***
like 12 (whole bspline many) but strict

*** version 18 ***
like 15 (fmap bspline few) but strict
